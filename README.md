# rpg-dice-roller
an rpg dice roller written in python
This is my first coding project. I've been playing dnd lately and it inspired me to write a dice rolling program.
Not that it's easier or faster or more fun than rolling dice, but it gave a me a good idea as a jumping off point to start working on my own projects.
